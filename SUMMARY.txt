CM3035 - ADVANCED WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSEWORK 1 SUMMARY
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Build a RESTful web application using Django that stores data in a relational 
database (SQLite3) and performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
on that data. Worth 50% of module grade.

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
================================================================================

1. CHOOSE A DATASET
   - Maximum 10,000 entries total (across all CSV files)
   - Can be medical, biological, financial, demographic, etc.
   - Can have multiple CSV files
   - Must justify the choice in your report
   - Resources:
     * https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/
     * https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
     * https://data.nhm.ac.uk/search

2. BUILD THE APPLICATION
   - Use Django framework
   - Use SQLite3 database (NOT PostgreSQL)
   - Implement proper Django Models with migrations
   - Use Django REST Framework
   - Implement 6 interesting RESTful endpoints:
     * At least ONE must use POST (to save new information)
     * At least ONE must use serialization
     * Endpoints should demonstrate complexity and Django knowledge
     * Example: "return a list of all road accidents involving alcohol use 
       during weekends"
   
3. DATA LOADING
   - Create a Python script/method to load CSV data into database
   - Script should perform necessary processing
   - Must be able to seed the database from scratch

4. UNIT TESTING
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for all endpoints
   - Tests should ensure API correctness

5. MAIN PAGE REQUIREMENTS
   - Implement endpoints as hyperlinks on main page
   - If using Swagger, access it via main page
   - Display:
     * Python version
     * Django version
     * Packages used
     * Admin site username and password

================================================================================

================================================================================
QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
================================================================================

Before starting, think about:

1. What dataset will allow me to create interesting, complex queries?
2. What 6 endpoints will best demonstrate my Django knowledge?
3. How should I structure my models to properly represent the data?
4. What validations are needed for data integrity?
5. How will I organize my code to be clean and maintainable?
6. What edge cases should my unit tests cover?
7. How will I make my endpoints interesting and non-trivial?
8. What makes my chosen dataset worth analyzing?

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

1. Find and download a suitable dataset (max 10,000 entries)
2. Analyze the data structure and plan your models
3. Sketch out 6 interesting endpoints
4. Set up Django project with virtual environment
5. Implement models and migrations
6. Create data loading script
7. Build REST endpoints
